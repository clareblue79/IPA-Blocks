#### Background
We wanted to create a set of blocks not unlike a set of childrenâ€™s alphabet blocks, but with the intention to teach people IPA - the International Phonetic Alphabet. IPA is the standard used in linguistics, however it can be tricky to learn. Students often rely on charts of letters with audio files, and those charts, while helpful, are not intuitive or fun to use. IPA Blocks creates a tangible way to interface with and learn IPA, allowing users to learn sounds in a more natural, entertaining way. Each block represents a single letter, and can be used with the application to create that sound wherever it is placed, creating a solid connection between the letter and the sound.

#### Conceptual Design 
Each token represents a single letter in IPA, and has both that letter and the braille for the letter on the top of each block. When used on the application, the block will either cause that letter to be pronounced, or be used as that letter in a word. The blocks are a tangible representation of each of the letters in IPA, and will be fun to use and hold. The application will have basic information about each letter, accessible through the blocks, as well as games that can be played using the tokens as the game pieces.
